# Amino-Acid-Helper
A small program to help convert RNA codons to amino acids. It is desined to convert many RNA codons to the respective Amino Acids.

This project isn't fully finished. It still works and does what it was originally desgined to do.

Controls:
1: RNA codon(s) to Amino Acid(s)
2: Single character Amino Acid code to Amino Acid
3: Amino Acid to RNA codon

I know it isn't prefect.
